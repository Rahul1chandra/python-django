1)  Read about the authentications and authorization 
            authentications (user is know to us or not )
                            ( candidate/superuser/annonymous )
            
            authorization (to check if user is having access to the particular page or not or actions ..)

2) basic python questions 
        2.1) Reverse a list/string
        2.2) Difference between mutable and immuatable (objects- like String)
        2.3) Implement oops concepts by using "food ordering application" ===  shell based applications 
                    Implement //  user_food_request
                            //    create a food menu   [ {name: "honeyginger_bread" : price: 500} ]
